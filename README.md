Dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

Dwm is created by the good folks at suckless.org.  This is my personal build of dwm. 

Most of the configuration is forked from: 
[dwm-distrotube](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dwm-distrotube)
[dwmblocks-distrotube](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dwmblocks-distrotube)
[dmenu-distrotube](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dmenu-distrotube)
[dmscripts](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dmscripts).
